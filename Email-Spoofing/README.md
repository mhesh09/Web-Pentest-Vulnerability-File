# Email Spoofing
    Email Spoofing is the creation of an email address with the forged sender address. It is a part of phishing attacks.
    Basically, emails are transfered through the SMTP protocol where it needs the sender email address and receipt address 
    inorder to send an email.
    
    In Emails, there are some few basic things we need to understand which are:
    
   # SPF(Secure Protocol Framework)
            It is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses in emails. Domain owners can 
            publish SPF records to DNS. In that record, they can whitelist IP addresses that can send emails for their domain.
            Email Servers can then perform the SPF lookup when they receive an email for the (claimed) sender's domain.
            
            We can validate SPF record by using dig command:
                    dig google.com txt | grep spf 
                    google.com.		2273	IN	TXT	"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
                    
                    For more information about SPF records please follow this URL: http://www.open-spf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax/
            
   # DKIM(DomainKeys Identified Mail)
            It is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses in emails.It works by 
            cryptographically signing sent emails from a given domain.The corresponding public key is published to the DNS
            records where email servers that receive those mails can get it and verify it.
            DKIM makes sure that nobody tampered with the email after it was sent.Imagin DKIM like a seal. SPF then is the 
            knowledge which seal should be used.
            
            
            To verify DKIM we need to look in email: Sample:
            
            DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=medium.com; 
            h=content-type:from:mime-version:reply-to:to:subject:list-unsubscribe;
            s=m1; bh=NY62YFtbfuXkL/SNoiClZV8gaZxkiYhFD4J77gUHGEY=; 
            b=EL3HbaL iSgAJsE6LO8L10T52+rYyump4R1aMAV9nCwyXLENaxbS0xgZvksgoplu8Rjo/
            wWV J0jDEFRe+UsOnIhaCTBXa1H7LVdjkRyOu9+9Qwd7hlWY5fx/mtRQXvWRDfe9KEsS 9WH8o0lRbOAq7AJXPLID/tZokm+KIMmMc/H0=
            
            Where,
                v : DKIM version
                a : The signature algorithm, typically rsa-sha256
                c : The canonicalization algorithm. The first value is for the header, the second one for the body of the email.
                d : The used domain.
                h : The headers.
                s : The DKIM selector record name.
                b : The base64 encoded hash value of the headers h .
                bh : The hash of the body of the email.
            
            
            
   
   # DMARC(Domain-based Message Authentication,Reporting,and Conformance)
            It is an email authentication protocol. DMARC uses SPF and DKIM and gives policies on how to deal with error cases.
            The domain owner creates a DMARC DNS record that contains instructions on what to do with messages that failed the 
            SPF/DKIM test.Instructions can either be rejected type or report type.
            
            To verify DMARC we need to use dig command:
                dig _dmarc.google.com txt | grep DMARC
                _dmarc.google.com.	300	IN	TXT	"v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:mailauth-reports@google.com"
                
                Where,
                    v : The protocol version.
                    p : The policy. It typically should be reject , but can also be quarantine
                    rua : The reporting URI for aggregate reports (how the domain is used)
                    ruf : The reporting URI for forensic reports (showing when validation failed)
                    pct : How many percent of mails get handled with DMARC. You can set this to an integer 
                    from 0 to 100. For the beginning, you can set it low for testing. It should become 100 over time.
                    If you don’t use the tag at all, it’s by default 100%.
