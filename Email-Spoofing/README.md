# Email Spoofing
    Email Spoofing is the creation of an email address with the forged sender address. It is a part of phishing attacks.
    Basically, emails are transfered through the SMTP protocol where it needs the sender email address and receipt address 
    inorder to send an email.
    
    In Emails, there are some few basic things we need to understand which are:
    
   # SPF(Secure Protocol Framework)
            It is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses in emails. Domain owners can 
            publish SPF records to DNS. In that record, they can whitelist IP addresses that can send emails for their domain.
            Email Servers can then perform the SPF lookup when they receive an email for the (claimed) sender's domain.
            
   # DKIM(DomainKeys Identified Mail)
            It is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses in emails.It works by 
            cryptographically signing sent emails from a given domain.The corresponding public key is published to the DNS
            records where email servers that receive those mails can get it and verify it.
            DKIM makes sure that nobody tampered with the email after it was sent.Imagin DKIM like a seal. SPF then is the 
            knowledge which seal should be used.
   
   # DMARC(Domain-based Message Authentication,Reporting,and Conformance)
            It is an email authentication protocol. DMARC uses SPF and DKIM and gives policies on how to deal with error cases.
            The domain owner creates a DMARC DNS record that contains instructions on what to do with messages that failed the 
            SPF/DKIM test.Instructions can either be rejected type or report type.
