# GraphQL
  GraphQL has been represents as a good alternative for REST API. It is developed by Facebook and used internally since 2012.


# Finding Endpoint.
   If application is using Apollo Framework the you can use the Apollo_Framework_Endpoint.txt to find the endpoint.
  
   Another way to identify a hidden endpoint is by searching some keywords in JavaScripts files like "query","mutation","graphql".
  
  
 # GraphQL Introspection
   Introspection is the ability to query which resources are available in the current API schema.We can see
        the queries,types,fields, and directives it support.
        
  # Request to perform Introspection is given below:
        
         {__schema{queryType{name}mutationType{name}subscriptionType{name}types{...FullType}directives{name description locations args{...InputValue}}}}fragment FullType on __Type{kind name description fields(includeDeprecated:true){name description args{...InputValue}type{...TypeRef}isDeprecated deprecationReason}inputFields{...InputValue}interfaces{...TypeRef}enumValues(includeDeprecated:true){name description isDeprecated deprecationReason}possibleTypes{...TypeRef}}fragment InputValue on __InputValue{name description type{...TypeRef}defaultValue}fragment TypeRef on __Type{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name ofType{kind name}}}}}}}}
         
         
# Query flaws
    The principal problem in GraphQL is flaw in Query which leads to the Improper Access Control and IDOR.We can
    do fuzzing inorder to explore other fields in Object.
    
# Mutations Flaws
    Mutations are used when web application perform modification actions on data.It also lead to Improper 
    Access Control,IDOR and mass assignment vulnerability(i.e Registeration Form).
    
    Other Vulerability we can try is
    a)SQL injection
    b) Debug & information disclosure ---> Insert bad characters in object or fields name, sometimes DEBUG mode is activated
        and even if you have a 403 status, you could have a good surpise.
    c) Batching Attack ---> It is process of taking a group of requests, combining them into one, and making a single request
        with the same data that all of the other queries would have more.It can be used to bypass rate-limit against 2FA 
        authentication.
