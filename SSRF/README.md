# SSRF(Server Side Request Forgery)
        It is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP 
        requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.	The attacker might cause the server to
        make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure.They may able 
        to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems, potentially leaking sensitive data such 
        as authorization credentials.

# Tools to used in order to exploit SSRF:
  
        a)SSRFmap
              when we are sure about some parameter is vulnerable to SSRF we can use this tool to escalate the 
              SSRF to RCE. It contains module which is used for		reading arbitary file, portscan,fastcgi etc.
              For more detail about module we can visit to https://github.com/swisskyrepo/SSRFmap  .
              
        b)Gopherus
              This is same like SSRFmap. Whenever you know the vulnerable parameter for SSRF we can use exploit,
              escalating process from SSRF to RCE.Detail about exploit are in this url:
              https://github.com/tarunkant/Gopherus   .
              
        c)See-SURF
              This is the tool which is used to scan for the SSRF vulnerable parameter. Basically it recon the 
              url parameter and notify the url where it contain those parameter.For more information we can go
              to this URL https://github.com/In3tinct/See-SURF    .
              
          Note:
             a)Goper Protocol
                    It is communication protocol which is used for distributing, searching and retrieving
                    documents in Internet Protocol networks.Before World Wide Web(www), goper protocol is used. 
                    It is predecessor of the World Wide Web.
